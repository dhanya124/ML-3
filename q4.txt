X is input matrix of size N X F
y is ouput matrix of size N 
Assuming number of classes in the data are k
W is the weight matrix of size F x K

Learning:
Calculating X * W takes O(N*F*K) time
Calculating softmax takes O(N*K) time 
updating weights takes O(N*F*K) time
Total time taken = O(N*F*K)+O(N*K) = O(N*F*K) per iteration



Prediction:
Calculating X * W takes O(N*F*K) time
Calculating softmax takes O(N*K) time 
Total time taken = O(N*F*K)+O(N*K) = O(N*F*K) 

space complexity = O(N * F)+O(N)+O(F*K)
